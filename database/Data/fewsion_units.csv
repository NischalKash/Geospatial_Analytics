1,"barrel ",Barrels (b) are a common unit of volume for measuring liquid fuels production and consumption. A barrel is approximately 42 gallons.
2,dollar,A unit of currency equivalent to United States Dollars for the year 2012. FEWSION typically displays currency in millions of dollars ($MM).
3,GWh,Gigawatt hours (GWh) are a unit of energy for measuring large amounts of energy production and consumption
4,mcf,Million cubic feet (mcf) is a common unit of volume for measuring natural gas production and consumption.
5,Mm³,"Million cubic meters (Mm³) is a common unit to measure large volumes of water. "
6,MW,Megawatts (MW) is a unit of power for measuring large amounts of power production and consumption.
7,tonne,A unit of mass equivalent to a metric tonne (t). FEWSION typically displays mass units in thousand metric tonnes (kt)
8,VW Consumption (Mm³),"Virtual water consumption in million cubic meters per year (Mm³ yr⁻¹). "
9,VW Withdrawals (Mm³),Virtual water withdrawals in million cubic meters per year (Mm³ yr⁻¹).
10,WSI,WSI is a water scarcity index that measures how much water is consumed relative to how much is available. A WSI closer to 1 indicates that water consumption is close to water availability.
11,IWSI,IWSI is a measure of water scarcity in a state or county's supply chain. An IWSI closer to 1 indicates that water consumption in a supply chain is close to water availability in a supply chain.
12,IWSI Contribution,IWSI contribution is a measure of an individual county's contribution to water scarcity in a state or county's supply chain.
13,BWF - Withdrawals (Mm³),A state or county's blue water footprint (BWF) is measured as a volume of water (Mm³). It's equal to a state or county's water use plus its virtual water balance. Virtual water balance is equivalent to virtual water inflows minus virtual outflows. For the
14,"BWF - Consumption (Mm³) ",A state or county's blue water footprint (BWF) is measured as a volume of water (Mm³). It's equal to a state or county's water use plus its virtual water balance. Virtual water balance is equivalent to virtual water inflows minus virtual outflows. For the
15,Shannon Diversity Index (SI),"Shannon Diversity Index is an index to measure supply chain diversity, or resilience. A Shannon Diversity Index closer to 1 indicates a more diverse supply chain where many sources are relied upon equally. A Shannon Diversity Index closer to 0 indicates t"
